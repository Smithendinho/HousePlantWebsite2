                    <h2 class="text-center fw-bold py-3">5 house plants that are (almost) impossible to kill <hr></h2>

                        <p class="lead">House plants can be the perfect addition to any home, adding both colour and an element of nature. However, not all houseplants are created equal when it comes to their resilience, meaning some are easier to care for than others. If you’ve ever killed a houseplant before, you may want to choose one of these five house plants that are almost impossible to kill! From small succulents to large ferns, there’s sure to be something on this list of 5 house plants that are almost impossible to kill that’s right for you and your space.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold py-2">Succulents</h4>
                        <p class="lead">The easiest way to keep succulents alive is keeping them in bright indirect sunlight, so they can absorb as much light as possible. They also need a lot of water, so be sure not to let the soil dry out and only water them about once a month. The last thing you want is for them to get water logged which will eventually cause the roots to rot and kill the plant.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold py-2">Aloe vera</h4>
                        <p class="lead">Aloe vera is a succulent plant with thick, fleshy leaves. The aloe plant has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries and, in recent years, has been shown to have healing properties for skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, and sunburns. Aloe vera can also be grown indoors, even if you don't have much room or a green thumb! 
                            Aloe needs bright light but not direct sunlight.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold py-2">Snake plant</h4>
                        <p class="lead">The snake plant, also known as mother-in-law's tongue or sansevieria, is a hardy and versatile plant. It's an evergreen perennial that can grow in both low light and high light conditions, so it can be placed anywhere in the home. It doesn't require much water or fertilization, either. In fact, this plant actually thrives better when you allow its soil to dry out between watering sessions.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold py-2">Philodendron</h4>
                        <p class="lead">Philodendron is one of the most popular indoor house plants and with good reason: they're a low-maintenance plant and they come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. They can be grown as either a ground cover or a vine; both will fill out nicely in no time. With their glossy green leaves, philodends make for excellent living room decor.</p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold py-2">Fiddle leaf fig</h4>
                        <p class="lead">The fiddle leaf fig is one of the most common and easiest to care for indoor plants. They're also one of the most beautiful, with their long, dark green leaves and gorgeous red or purple flowers. They thrive in low light, they don't need much water and they don't require a lot of attention. Fiddle leaf figs can do well outside if they're protected from wind and frost.</p>
